# Real-Time Sign Language Detection Using Gesture Recognition And Natural Language Processing

## Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive system for sign language detection and translation by 
leveraging advancements in gesture recognition and natural language processing (NLP) 
technologies. The system integrates the YOLOv5 object detection framework with NLP techniques 
to enable real-time interpretation of sign language gestures and their conversion into understandable 
textual or spoken language. By bridging the communication gap between sign language users and 
non-signers, the system seeks to empower individuals with hearing impairments to express 
themselves more freely and engage with the broader community on a level playing field
